"""Caption generation pipeline components.

This package exposes a light-weight 360Â° captioning pipeline composed of
specialised panoramic frame samplers, audio/visual encoder backbones and a
decoder head built on top of Hugging Face ``transformers``.  The modules are
designed to be easily swappable via the :mod:`captionqa.captioning.config`
factory helpers while keeping the public API as simple as calling
``generate_captions``.
